# Monks-Decision-Tree

Statement: This project demonstrates how a fixed length decision tree can be implemented using the ID3 algorithm. 

A. Use the Monks data set to create the decision tree. <br/>
B. Learn the decision tree and compute the average training and test errors on each of the three Monk's problems. Plot the training and test errors against the tree depth for the same. <br/>
C. Report the decision tree and the confusion matrix on the test set for depth = 1,2,5. <br/>
D. Use scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier to learn a decision tree using criterion="entropy" for depth = 1,2,5. <br/>
E. Repeat the procedure with the Cryotherapy dataset and note the results.
